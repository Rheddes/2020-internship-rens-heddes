The Data Management Plan (DMP) is created at the beginning of a
research project.  At that time, not all details will typically be
available, leaving some gaps to be filled in later. During the
project, the DMP is kept updated by the Project Leader, who notifies
their SIG Supervisor of all updates.

# Data Sources
Please identify all data sources that will be used or generated during

# Sharing of Data 
Please list the Data Sources that are intended to be shared outside of

SIG. In case of Confidential Data, explicit permission from the SIG
supervisor is required before sharing, and special measures of
anonymization are typically mandatory. Also in cases of Public Data,
anonymization can be required to comply with GDPR regulations.
